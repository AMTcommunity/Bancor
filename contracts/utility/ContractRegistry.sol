/**
    Contract Registry

    The contract registry keeps contract addresses by name.
    The owner can update contract addresses so that a contract name always points to the latest version
    of the given contract.
    Other contracts can query the registry to get updated addresses instead of depending on specific
    addresses.

    Note that contract names are limited to 32 bytes, UTF8 strings to optimize gas costs
